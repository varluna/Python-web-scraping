# **My Network Course Scraper**
This project contains a web scraping code I developed while studying for a network course. The code is designed to scrape questions and answers from the course's website. It was particularly useful for me collecting and organizing the questions in the online book.

**Features** <br>
**Targeted Scraping:** Efficiently extracts either questions or answers based on user input and functions. <br>
**Customizable:** Easily adaptable to every other chapters. <br>
**Python-based:** Leveraging powerful libraries for web scraping. <br>
